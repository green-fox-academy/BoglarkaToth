 *  with a restriction, they cannot punch other heroes from the same "Universe":
 *   - A MarvelHero shouldn't be able to punch another MarvelHero 
 *   - A DCHero shouldn't be able to punch another DCHeroe
 *  Also they should have a default motivation if only name is passed to the constructor. Default values:
 *   - MarvelHero: 40
 *   - DCHero: 45
 *  You don't need to modify this file, just add your imports/requires to it.
